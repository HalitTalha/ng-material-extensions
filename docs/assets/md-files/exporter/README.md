This package is to make MatTable components exportable in ***excel, csv, txt*** and ***json*** formats. ***Pagination is also supported***. Applying MatTableExporter directive to your MatTable is enough to make it exportable. The directive uses different exporter services for different exporting types. You can also implement your own exporter and use it for your custom exporting requirements.

This project employs <a href="https://github.com/SheetJS/js-xlsx" target="_blank">xlsx sheetjs</a>, which is a great library and mature enough for the excel creation itself. In order to achieve a cross-browser file saving capability <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/" target="_blank">FileSaverjs</a> is employed.

The MatTableExporter directive inside this package is a cdk-table-exporter subtype and provides support for angular material's cdkTable.
cdk-table-exporter facilitates the common exporting related functionalities for CdkTable implementations abstracting the behavior that can change among different CdkTables.
